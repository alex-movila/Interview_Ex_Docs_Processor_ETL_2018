Charles John Huffam Dickens (/ˈdɪkɪnz/; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.
He created some of the world's best-known
fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.[1] His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity
during his lifetime,
and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.[2][3]

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison.
Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories
and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously
for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.

Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers.
Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity,
famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society.
His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became
the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.
[4][5] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] 
The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development 
based on such feedback.[5] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield 
seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.[7] His plots were carefully constructed, and he 
often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[8] Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly
episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.[9]
